## 🚀 Feature Engineering 
A hands-on exploration of feature engineering techniques using different real Kaggle datasets.
This project is all about taking raw, messy data and turning it into something more meaningful. I focused on things like handling missing values, scaling, encoding, dealing with outliers, building pipelines, and a bunch of other transformations that change how models behave. It is less about chasing accuracy and more about understanding how data can be shaped, cleaned, and redesigned before it ever reaches the model.
